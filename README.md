## What is Web Scraping?

The process of web scraping involves fetching or downloading a web page, extracting data from it, and saving it to a DB or spreadsheet. It is an automated process of retrieving structured data from a website. 

## Why Web Scraping?

Consider that you need to collect data from a website. There are three different ways to collect Structured Data from a website.

1. Download .csv file from a website

You can download the .csv extension file from a website but not in all cases this file is available. In most of the cases, attachments/downloads aren't available.

2. Copy and Paste to a CSV or Excel File

This is the simplest step you can do but it is meant for hard-working people and not smart working. It is time-consuming and complex when there are multiple records to look at. When it comes to multiple web pages or multiple web sites then the task gets tedious and also impossible in some use cases by this technique.

3. API (Application Programming Interface)

APIs are comparatively simpler and a better choice than the rest of the two but it is charged and is costly. Also, it does not provide relevant data in the preferred structure. It also takes time to request data using an API.

#### To overcome the above shortcomings, we can replace these traditional methods with web scraping. 

## Usage of Web Scraping - Examples
